<br style="font-family: Calibri;">
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Welcome to the
Daz-to-3DSMax Pipeline</span><br style="font-family: Calibri;">
<br style="font-family: Calibri;">
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The purpose of this
project is to provide a clean pipeline between Daz and Max, enabling
Daz's&nbsp;rich figure creation tools and content library to be
utilised in powerful 3D modeller and renderer that is Max.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview</span><br>
<br>
This project consists of four components:<br>
</span>
<ul style="font-family: Calibri;">
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Daz Plugin</span><br>
This unmanaged C++ plugin appears to Daz as an exporter, based on a
QObject (Daz uses Qt throughout). It is responsible for collecting the
data from Daz via the Daz provided SDK and packing it into a binary
stream.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Serialiser</span><br>
MessagePack is a cross-language serialiser/deserialiser/message
interchange format similar to JSON that can be used to exchange binary
data. Implementations of it in C++ and C# are used to get the scene
data between the Daz Plugin and the managed layer. It handles all the
serialisation, deserialisation, and file layout.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Managed
Layer</span><br>
Once the plugin has packed the scene data, the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">managed</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">layer</span> uses
MessagePack to unpack them into a structure in 'managed space' that can
be accessed by CLR based programs (guess which ones...)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The MaxScript</span><br>
Finally, a MaxScript script loads the .NET library (the managed layer)
and uses its methods to read the scene data into Max, using the Max API
to create and configure objects.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Project Status</span><br
 style="font-family: Calibri;">
<br style="font-family: Calibri;">
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The project has not
been released (that means it isn't anywhere near an alpha stage let
alone anywhere else)</span><br style="font-family: Calibri;">
