To Do List

1. Do proper opacity map adjustment so opacity maps on things such as eyelashes behave in Max as they do in Daz
2. Make enumeration of top level entities in Daz more efficient
3. Improve efficiency of updating vertex positions in Max (or some other way improve speed such as multithreaded updates, or only updating changed vertices)

Roadmap

1. Link scene updates to changed signals in Max
2. Include basic skinning for standard Max bones (for basic pose adjustments)
