2. MaxScript sets diffuse to 0 on import (why do we need this again?)

3. add colour conversion

4. do proper opacity map adjustment



Roadmap

1. Daz plugin converted to utility
2. Implement communication between managed lib and daz plugin
3. Have managed plugin pull selected daz objects directly
4. Have managed plugin present daz scene to user
5. Have managed plugin update specific items instead of creating new ones (from scratch - i.e. same node new geom)
6. Update specific geom components
7. Link this to changed event in daz


Basic skinning for pose adjustments

BUGS!!

- default genesis, lots of empty maps are made when no maps should be made...
