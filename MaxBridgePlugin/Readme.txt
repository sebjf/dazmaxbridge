This library requires the MAX.NET plugin from ESphere for all versions of Max up to 2012.

For 2012 and onwards there is an Autodesk provided wrapper that replaces ESphere's MAX.NET, however this library was written for MAX.NET so some adjustments may be required.

And always remember to target .NET 3.5 Client framework!!!!
