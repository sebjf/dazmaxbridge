1. MaxScript sets diffuse to 0 on import (why do we need this again?)
2. do proper opacity map adjustment

Roadmap

1. Have managed plugin pull selected daz objects directly
2. Have managed plugin present daz scene to user
3. Have managed plugin update specific items instead of creating new ones (from scratch - i.e. same node new geom)
4. Update specific geom components
5. Link this to changed event in daz

Basic skinning for pose adjustments
